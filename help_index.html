UT Austin's library system is powered by commercial library software developed by <a href="http://www.iii.com/">Innovative Interfaces Inc.</a>  The correction of some of the problems that users may encounter may be outside our control.  We report problems to the vendor as they arise and follow up on possible local solutions.  However, limitations in the vendor's programming and support capacities mean that software enhancements and non-critical fixes are unlikely to happen in the short term. Known issues that we cannot immediately address are noted in the help sections on this page.

<p> <H2><a name="searches"><u>SEARCH OPTIONS</u> </a></H2> </p>

<p> <a name="keyword"><strong>Keyword (Basic)</strong></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is the default search for the Library Catalog.  Type one or more keywords in the box.  These could include topical concepts, personal author/performer/composer names, organization or conference names, words from subject headings, or any other words that might appear in a catalog record.  <strong>Keyword searches access only the words found in bibliographic records in the Library Catalog.  You are not searching the full text of a book or articles within periodicals.</strong>  </p>

  <p> The more words you type, the more focused your search becomes.  If you retrieve no or too few hits, try re-entering your search with fewer terms.  If you retrieve too many hits, try re-entering your search with additional terms.  All search terms are case-insensitive. </p>

  <p>The order of the words entered does not matter. If you type two or more words, the Catalog assumes an AND operator, which means that all words you type must be found in a record.  To search an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks.</p>

 <P>

</blockquote>

<a href="#top">Back to Top </a>

<p> <strong><a name="advkw">Keyword (Advanced Search)</a></strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Advanced Keyword Search offers the most flexible set of options for locating information in the Library Catalog. </p>

  <p> The search form has a text box  where you may type one or more words and combine them with Boolean operators (AND, OR, AND NOT) to indicate how the terms must be related to each other.  Below the search box are optional limits you may place on your search results. 
<p>
Boolean Operators available include:<br>

<UL>
<li> AND - Both words must occur somewhere in the record (implied by default) </li> 
<li> OR  -  One or both words must occur somewhere in the record.</li>
<li> AND NOT -  Excludes any record containing the following word.</li>
<li> " ... " -  Quotation marks are used to denote exact phrases:  the words must occur in the order entered. </li>
</UL>

<p>

 You can also use prefixes in front of words to specify which fields to search.  Do not leave a space between the colon and the following character.   
 <UL>
 <li>Title (t:) </li>
 <li>Author (a:)</li>
 <li>Subject Heading (d:)  (d stands for Descriptor) </li>
 <li>Note (n:).  (Note fields contain many kinds of additional information about the item, including contents, formats, origins, languages, details about such film casts, listing of songs or musical pieces on compact discs, etc.  Some records have extensive notes, while others have few.  Most note fields are keyword-searchable.)
</li>
</UL>

 </p>


<p>
You can construct a complex search query using Boolean operators, field prefixes, wildcards, and <a href="#nesting">parentheses</a>.  (All words and operators are case-insensitive but operators are shown in caps below for clarity.)  Examples: 
<blockquote>
<DL>
<dt> <b> (car* or automobile*) AND (exhaust or emission*)  </b>  </dt>
<dd> A form of the word "car" or the word "automobile" must be accompanied by either the word "exhaust" or a form of "emission" anywhere in the record. Typing the AND is optional; it's implied.</dd>
<dt> <b> "climate change" OR "global warming" </b> </dt>
<dd> The phrase "climate change" or the phrase "global warming" (exactly as typed) must occur somewhere in the record. </dd>
<dt> <b> a:mozart t:(sonatas OR fugues)  </b>  </dt>
<dd>Mozart as an author with either "sonatas" or "fugues" in a title. The AND linking the a: term and the t: terms is implied, but you can include it if you wish.</dd>
<dt> <b> a:brown a:foote  </b>  </dt>
<dd>Both are author names to be searched separately in author fields. The AND is implied.  Note:  The search <b>a:(brown foote) </b> will not work here because the two author names are in different author fields.  </dd>
<dt> <b> a:(richard feynman)  </b> </dt>
<dd>The words must occur within a single author field, i.e. parts of the same author's name.  With the AND operator (typed or implied) the order of the words does not matter. This kind of search can also be applied to conference names and corporate author names:  <b>a:(solar energy) </b> or <b>a:(electrochemical society)</b> </dd>
<dt> <b> a:smith texas  </b> </dt>
<dd>Author name "smith" with the word "texas" anywhere in the record.  The AND is implied. </dd>
<dt> <b> a:woodward AND d:(watergate OR nixon)  </b>  </dt>
<dd>Author name "woodward" with subject headings containing either "watergate" or "nixon". </dd>
<dt> <b> t:texas AND n:yarborough  </b>  </dt>
<dd>The word "texas" in a title with the name "yarborough" in a note field. </dd>
<dt> <b> d:(world war) clemenceau  </b> </dt>
<dd> Words "world war" in a subject heading and the name "clemenceau" anywhere in the record.  The AND operators are implied. </dd>
<dt> <b> web AND NOT d:spider*  </b>  </dt>
<dd>Finds "web" anywhere in the record but excludes records with forms of the word "spider" in a subject heading. </dd>
<dt> <b> "cattle ranch"~3  </b>  </dt>
<dd>"cattle" must appear in the same field as words with "ranch" with no more than three word in between. </dd>

</blockquote>
<p>

  <p> You may apply one or more Limit options to your search.  The Limits available include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Available items (items not checked out) </li>
    <li> Items in a specific library location or branch </li>
    <li> Specific material types and formats (1) </li>
    <li> Specific languages (1) </li>
    <li> Publication year or range of years (2) </li>
    <li> Publisher </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  1.  You can select multiple entries from this menu by holding down the Control key (Windows) or Apple key (Macintosh) while clicking on desired entries.
<p>
2.  Dates are <strong>exclusive</strong>:  If you enter After 2003 Before 2005 you will retrieve only records with dates of 2004. </p>
</blockquote>

  <p> You can select a sorting parameter (Date or Title) in place of the default Relevancy Ranking categories.  Note:  If you use a field limiter in your query, or if you use quotation marks to designate a phrase, the ranking of results is by date, and can't be changed.   </p>

  <p> See the <a href="#limit">Limiting</a>  section of the Guide for more information on limiting keyword searches. </p>

KNOWN ISSUE:  Modify Search Button from Keyword Search Results <br>
When you click the Modify Search button at the top of a keyword search results screen, you will return to the Advanced Search page, and your keyword query will be retained.  However, if you selected choices from the Locations, Material Types, or Language menus, these selections are not retained.  This is a result of the way those menus are programmed, and can't be fixed.

  <p> See the <a href="#tips">Search Tips</a>  section for more information on Keyword searching techniques. </p>
</blockquote>

<a href="#top">Back to Top </a>

<p> <a name="title"><strong>Title</strong></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> This is a browse search.  If you know the first words of a title, use this search.  If you have less information, use the Keyword Search to locate a title with a certain word or word combination.  A title search will retrieve alternate titles and series titles in addition to regular titles. </p>

  <p> Type the title in exact order. Right-hand truncation is implied, so you can stop typing as soon as you have entered enough of the title to be distinctive.
  </p>
  <p>
  You should omit initial articles: A, AN, and THE in English (although the system will automatically ignore these anyway), and the equivalent articles in other languages.  If you want to force a search on an initial article just enclose it in quotes ("a", "an", "the").     </p>

  <p> All searches are case-insensitive and you can omit punctuation and diacritics. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Examples: </p>
    <p> To find: THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, type: old man and the sea </p>
    <p> To find: L'&Eacute;TRANGER, type: etranger </p>
    <p> To find:  DIE FLEDERMAUS, type fledermaus </p>
    <p> To find:  JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS, type: journal of applied mech </p>
    <p> To find:  SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, type:  slaughterhouse f </p>
  </blockquote>
  
KNOWN ISSUE:  "Hidden" entries in Title browse results <br>
Occasionally when you do a Title browse search, the title you're looking for will not be evident in the list of results.  Instead, it will be 
"hidden" inside a group of records under a totally unrelated title that appears first in the list.  It affects records that contain multiple titles and you'll see it most often related to music albums, story anthologies, and other collections that have titles within titles.  This is not actually a bug, since the system is designed to behave this way, but it's confusing.  This affects only Title browse searches, and you will not encounter it in author, keyword, author+title, or other searches. Another workaround is to select "Title" in the dropdown sorting menu and then click "Sort".  This forces the display into brief record mode and makes the list less confusing.  
<p>
</blockquote>

<a href="#top">Back to Top </a>

<p> <a name="journaltitle"><strong>Journal Title</strong></a> </p>
<blockquote>

Two separate search options are available on this page. (<a href="#jt2">Why is this?</a>) You should use both options in turn to ensure complete coverage of availability.  
<p>
<i>Remember that these searches find journals and other serials in library collections, NOT their contents.  If you're looking for articles, you'll need to use a database that indexes articles.  Go to the <a href="http://wiki.lib.utexas.edu/hdi/pmwiki.php?action=search&q=find+articles"> How Do I Find Articles</a> page for more information.  </i>
<p>
<strong>Serial Title</strong>
<p>
The top search box is a title browse search that finds only <b>serials</b> that are included in the Library Catalog:  periodicals, journals, magazines, newspapers, annuals, and other serially published works.  If you know you're looking for a serial (and not a book or other single work), this is a more precise alternative to a general Title search.  If you don't know the exact title of the journal or periodical, use the Keyword search options instead.  If you do not find the journal you're looking for, use the E-Journal search option as well.
<p>

Omit initial articles (A, AN, THE and non-English equivalents) from your query, and type as much of the title as you know in exact word order.  Right-hand truncation is implied.
<p>
  

  <blockquote>
    <p> To find:   JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN, type:   </p>
    <p> journal of mechanical design  </p>
    <p> OR  </p>
    <p> journal of mechanical des </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Don't use abbreviated journal titles such as:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> J. Mech. Des. </p>
  </blockquote>


<p>
<a name="ejournal"><strong>E-Journal Title</strong></a>
</p>

  <p>
  This search queries the Libraries' electronic journal database, which is separate from the Library Catalog.  You can enter an exact title or words from a title to retrieve entries for periodicals and journals for which we have some form of electronic access.  To return to the Library Catalog after this search, click your browser's Back button.
</p>

  <p>
The E-Journal search does not retrieve information about printed journals and periodicals that might be held in the library collections.  
</p>

<a name="jt2"> <strong> Why are there TWO search boxes? </strong> </a>
<p>
Unfortunately, information about journal availability is contained in two separate databases, which must be searched independently.  The Libraries are exploring ways to integrate this information better, but for the time being you have to search in both places to be sure you're covering all the bases.    A quick summary of the two databases: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Library Catalog:  contains all serials with print or microform holdings in UT Libraries; serials with some print holdings AND electronic access; some but not all electronic-only serials. </li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/journals/">E-Journals Database</a> (powered by SFX):  contains all serials with some electronic access, including many not represented in Library Catalog. </li>
</ol>

<p>
If you search both databases and do not find what you're looking for, you can submit a request for an article via Interlibrary Services (link at top of every catalog page), or ask for help at a reference desk.

<a name="author"><strong>Author</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a browse search.  Authors may be persons (including co-authors, editors, compilers, translators, composers, performers), organizations, musical groups, government agencies, or conference names.</p>

  <p>If you know the author's full name (or most of it), use this search. If you have less information, use the Keyword Search options (Basic or Advanced).  Using Advanced Search allows you to combine an author name with a keyword from the title or other field.  The Author + Title search option combines an author's name with word(s) from the title.</p>

    <p>To search for a person, type the name in reverse order (last name, first name, middle name or initial if known). You don't need to use any punctuation in your query.  Search terms are not case-sensitive. </p>
  <blockquote>
      <p>For example,</p>
    <p>  to find: ARTHUR C. CLARKE type: clarke arthur c or clarke, arthur c  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Note:  Birth and/or death dates sometimes displayed with an author's name are not part of the index entry and should not be included in your query.  </p>

  <p> To search for an organization, type enough of the name to be distinctive.   </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> For example,  </p>
    <p>  to find: AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE  </p>
    <p> type: american academy of pol  </p>

  <p> If your first search does not produce the expected results, try searching with different forms:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  INITIALS........ try SAMUELSON P as well as SAMUELSON PAUL  </li>
    <li>  ABBREVIATIONS... try CORP as well as CORPORATION  </li>
    <li>  NUMBERS......... try 19TH as well as NINETEENTH  </li>

<a name="at"><strong>Author + Title</strong></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  The Author + Title search option allows you to enter the name of an author (last name first) and combine it with a word from a title.  This option is useful for authors or composers with large numbers of publications and editions. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Example: </p>

<p><a name="lcsh"><strong>Subject Heading</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Use the Subject Heading Search to browse the alphabetical Subject Index, which contains a controlled vocabulary of subjects.  Subject headings often include detailed subheadings that subdivide a heading by topical, geographical, chronological, and format aspects.  The Library Catalog uses Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and MeSH (medical subject) headings.  </p>

  
  <p> The Subject Index includes the following types of entries:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Topic or concept........... FOREIGN TRADE REGULATION  </li>
    <li> Person as subject.......... KING MARTIN LUTHER  </li>
    <li> Organization as subject.... HARVARD UNIVERSITY  </li>
    <li> Literary work as subject... HAMLET  </li>
  </ul>
  <p> or... SHAKESPEARE WILLIAM 1564-1616 HAMLET  </p>
  
    <p>
  If you are not familiar with the structure of Subject Heading entries and their subdivisions, you can start with a Keyword search instead.  To identify a valid subject heading to search, start with a Keyword search, then:
<ol>
<li>  click the title to see the Full Display of a specific item </li>
<li> click on one of the SUBJECTS links to search all records for that Subject Heading. </li>

<blockquote>
  <p> Use the Call Number Search form to find a specific item, or to browse the shelves virtually within a subject area.  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Leave a space between each segment of the call number.  </li>
    <li> Include any punctuation, usually a decimal point.  </li>
    <li> You may type letters in lowercase or uppercase.  </li>
    <li> Do not confuse letters and numbers (examples: O for 0, or I for 1).  </li>
    <li> Do not type oversize codes (-F- or -Q-) or the library name.  </li>
    <li> Records from the Law Library's catalog are not searchable by call number; use Tallons instead.  </li>
    <li> Electronic-only materials in the catalog (such as e-books and e-only journals) do not have call numbers.  </li>

When you do a call number search for something with multiple pieces attached to the same parent record, such as a journal with many volumes, the results display one copy of that record for each item attached -- possibly hundreds -- and each display shows the same top three items.  To see a list of all attached items, click on the title, then click the View All Copies/Volumes button.  Or you can do the search by title or keyword to avoid this multiple display.

<p> <a name="callnolc"><strong>Library of Congress Call Number</strong> </a>   </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Most books and periodicals cataloged after 1970 are classified and shelved according to the Library of Congress call number system.  Call numbers are based on the item's subject.  LC call numbers consist of a combination of letters and numbers. The first two segments represent a subject area; the number is filed as a whole number.  The following segment(s) combine a letter with a decimal number.  A date may be appended at the end, followed by non-searchable volume-specific information.    </p>

  <p> Most federal documents held in the University Libraries use the U.S. Superintendent of Documents (SuDocs) classification number as a call number. However, some U.S. documents are assigned a different call number in the Catalog, and others are available only on the Web. The document number search option will also retrieve these.  </p>

<p> <a name="callnosubj"><strong>Call Number As Subject Search Alternative</strong> </a>   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> When you know the Library of Congress or Dewey call number of a relevant item, you may find more items on the same subject by typing the first one or two call number elements. Typing fewer elements widens the subject range of call numbers retrieved.  </p>

  <p> For example, the call number QD 79 C4 (for Chromatography) could be shortened to QD 79 to locate other items about analytical chemistry in general.  </p>

  <p> Call numbers are not consistently assigned over time, and materials on the same subject may be scattered across several different call number areas and classification systems. Browsing by call number is thus not a reliable substitute for doing other types of topical searches.   </p>

  <p> Other call numbers are not based on subject, so browsing these is not meaningful. Government Document call numbers are based on provenance (the originating government agency or subdivision), not subject.  </p>

  <p> You may apply one or more Limit options to your search via the Advanced Search form.  The Limits available include:  </p>

  <p> <u>Available items</u>  If you want to limit your results to items that are available in the library, check this box.   You will retrieve only records that have at least one item that is available for check-out or use in the library.  (Other attached items that are not available because they are currently checked out or otherwise unavailable may show up on the same records.)   </p>

  <p> <u>Items in a specific library location or branch</u>: Select one location from the pull-down menu provided.  </p>

<li> Some material formats are also listed in the location menu:  Journals, Compact Discs, DVDs, Dissertations/Theses, Microforms, and Electronic Resources.</li>
<li> When a location limit is used, items from that location will sort to the top of a multi-item list in the item summary.  </li>
<li> Sometimes you will retrieve records using a location limit, but not see any items from that location in the item summary.  This is because there is one or more withdrawn items from that location that is suppressed from view.  </li>

KNOWN ISSUE:  Retention of Location Limits<br>
When you pre-limit a search to a specific library location, that limit is retained when you select a different kind of search from the left-side search menu.  For example, if you do a title search limited to DVDs, then decide to do an author search for a book, you must reset the limit to the ALL COLLECTIONS default; otherwise you'll do your author search only among DVDs.   If you click the Start Over button after a search before selecting the new search type, the system will reset the default for you.

<dd>Definition:  Items included in the following classes of electronic resources: computer software (including programs, games and fonts), numeric data, computer-oriented multimedia, online systems or services.</dd>
<li> Archival Collections (Mixed) </li>
<dd>Definition:  Materials in two or more forms that are usually related by virtue of their having been accumulated by or about a person or body. The intended primary purpose is other than for instructional purposes. This category includes archival fonds and manuscript collections of mixed forms of materials, such as text, photographs and sound recordings.</dd>
<li> Archival Collections (Manuscripts) </li>
<dd>Definition:  Manuscripts are items written by hand or unpublished "single instance" items (a handwritten letter, hand-drawn map, handwritten score or galley proof). The handwritten or "single instance" characteristic distinguishes an item as a manuscript, compared with a mass printing, mass-produced or multiple-copy publications. Archival collections that are exclusively written materials (as opposed to collections that include other forms such as photographs, films, and other objects) receive this type.</dd>
<li> Films, Slides, etc. </li>
<dd>Definition:  Filmstrips, motion pictures, slides, transparencies, and material specifically designed for overhead projection.  Does not include DVDs or videocassettes in this catalog.</dd>
<li> Graphics, Charts, Art </li>
<dd>Examples:  Cards, charts, collages, computer graphics, drawings, duplication masters, flash cards, paintings, photonegatives, photoprints, pictures, postcards, posters, prints, spirit masters, study prints, technical drawings, transparency masters, photomechanical reproductions and reproductions of any of these.</dd>

<b>Important tips about using Material Types:</b>
<ul>


<li> A bibliographic record can have only one assigned Material Type.  In the brief results display, the Type is indicated by a small icon on the left hand side. </li>
<li> Material Type designations are not exclusive, and they have varying levels of specificity.  For example, a music LP recording might be assigned either the specific "Records (LP)" type, or the more general "Other Recorded Formats" type, but not both.   </li>
<li> To make sure you get full retrieval, select all relevant types from the menu to limit your search.  For music recording searches where you want to retrieve all possible formats, select "Compact Discs", "Records (LPs)", "Audio Cassettes", and "Other Recorded Formats". </li>
<li>If you are searching for archival materials in general, select both relevant types from the list:  Manuscripts and Mixed.  </li>
<li> There is no specific Material Type for microforms (microfilm, microfiche, etc.).  These are assigned the type of the original material, usually Books & Printed Materials.  There is a Microforms limit in the Location menu, which will cover most such items.</li>
<li> There is no specific Material Type for dissertations and theses.  Electronic Theses/Disserations (ETDs) are usually given the Books & Printed Materials type (because they are "published").  Printed dissertations and theses are desginated as Manuscripts (because they are "unpublished").  It's best to avoid using material type in a dissertation search.  Use the Dissertation/Theses "location" limit instead.</li>
<li> Journals/periodicals are not included in the Material Types because this limit is available in the Location menu. </li>
<li> It is not possible to exclude a particular material type from your results. </li>

</ul>
<p>

  <p> <a name="language"><u>Language</u></a>: You can select multiple entries from this menu by holding down the Control key (Windows) or Apple key (Macintosh) while clicking on desired entries.  </p>

  <p> The list is divided into two parts: the top section lists in alphabetical order the languages that occur most frequently in the Catalog database. The second section lists languages that are represented by at least 100 records in the Catalog database. If you need a search for items in languages not on this list, please consult with a librarian.  It is not possible to exclude a particular language from your results, but you can select multiple desired languages from the list and leave out those that you don't want.</p>

  <p> <a name="year"><u>Publication year or range of years</u></a>: Publication year searching is exclusive, not inclusive.  You can enter an AFTER or a BEFORE year, or both.  Examples:  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> AFTER 2004 retrieves records published in 2005 and later.  </li> 
    <li> BEFORE 2004 retrieves records published in 2003 and earlier.  </li> 
    <li> AFTER 2004 BEFORE 2006 retrieves only records published in 2005.   </li> 
  </ul>
  
  <p> To search for an item published in a specific year, type the prior year in the AFTER box and the following year in the BEFORE box, as shown in the third example.<p>

Searching for serials (journals, periodicals, etc.) using a Year limit is not advised.  If a serial has both a starting and an ending date, the ending date is the one searched.  If a serial has only a starting date, that is searched.  Dates found in serial catalog records are not always accurate, and they have nothing to do with the date of publication of any particular article.  
  </p>

  <p> <a name="publisher"><u>Publisher</u></a>: Enter one or more words from a publisher name.  </p>

<p> <a name="words"><strong>Searching Multiple Words (Keyword Search)</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> When searching multiple words the system will automatically supply the Boolean AND operator between each word.  Words entered for the search will all occur somewhere in each retrieved record, though not necessarily near each other or in the order entered.   </p>

  <p> Other Boolean operators that may be applied to keyword searches are OR and AND NOT.    </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Examples:  </p>
    <p> egypt OR cairo &ndash; finds records where either word is present, but not necessarily both.  </p>

    <p> mercury AND NOT planet* -- finds records with the word "mercury" excluding those containing variations of the word "planet".   Use the AND NOT operator with caution because you may inadvertently eliminate relevant results.  It is most useful when trying to distinguish words that have distinctly different meanings or contexts.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a href="#top">Back to Top </a>

<p> <a name="phrase"><strong>Phrase Searches (Keyword Search)</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Search for exact phrases by enclosing them in quotation marks "...". These words will appear together in all results exactly as typed.   The phrase search overrides the relevancy ranking feature when processing results.  Wildcards do not work in phrase searches. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a name="nesting"><strong>Nested Searches (Keyword Search)</strong></a>  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> A nested keyword search query can be constructed using Boolean operators and parentheses (...) to establish the relationship among the terms.   For example, to find records that contain the phrase "holy land" and either the word "palestine" or the word "israel," you would type:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "holy land" and (palestine or israel)  </p>
  </blockquote>
  If your query contains more than one kind of Boolean operator, you must use parentheses to define the relationship of your terms, otherwise the search engine will not combine them as you intend.  For example, the search
<blockquote>
fish and farm or raising
</blockquote>
should be typed as:
<blockquote>
fish and (farm or raising)
</blockquote>
If you leave out the parentheses, the search engine will rank the AND higher and give you results based on the logic
<blockquote>
(fish and farm) or raising
</blockquote>
which will not be useful.
<p>

 Note: A nested search overrides the relevancy ranking feature when processing results.

<p> <a name="within"><strong>Word Proximity Operator: ~N (Keyword Search)</strong></a>  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> You can type the operator ~N (tilde-N) following two keywords enclosed in quotes to retrieve records that contain the two words within N words of each other, in any order.  For example you could enter this query into a keyword search box:  </p>
  <blockquote>

<p> <a name="truncation"><strong>Truncation and Wildcards (Keyword Search)</strong></a>   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  <b>*</b> The asterisk matches any number of non-space characters, starting at the specified position in the word. For example, "intern*" will match "intern", "internal", "internet" and "international".  The asterisk wildcard may also be embedded in a word. For example, "colo*r" would match both "color" and "colour" and "sul*ur" would match both "sulfur" and "sulphur".  </p>

  <p> <b>?</b>  You may use a question mark to mask a single character anywhere within a word (e.g. wom?n will retrieve both "woman" and "women").  The ? wildcard symbol must be preceded by at least two characters.  For example, "m?n" will return no results.   </p>


  <p>Making a truncation too generic will result in slow response times and too many results.  Avoid queries such as un* or inter* or tex* that would retrieve a very large number of results.  Wildcards do not work inside quotes.  </p>

<p> <a name="fields"><strong>Field Limits (Keyword Search)</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> A field limit causes the system to search only within the specified set of fields for the specified word(s). Four field limits are available: Title, Author, Subject Heading, and Note.   </p>

  <p>
  You can use field limits on the Basic or Advanced Keyword pages by typing a field prefix in front of a term. There should not be a space between the colon and the next character. Use parentheses to enclose multiple terms to be found within a single field.</p>

  <p>
  Field limit prefixes are:
  <table border="1" cellpadding=4 cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
  <td>
  t: Title
  </td> <td> 
  t:catalysis <br>
  t:(gold rush)
  </td> </tr>
     <tr> <td>

  a: Author 
   </td> <td> 
   a:(kurt vonnegut) <br>
   a:woodward a:bernstein 
   
    </td> </tr>
     <tr> <td>

  d: Subject Heading 
   </td> <td> 
   d:(global warming)
   <tr> <td>
  n: Note 
    </td> <td> 
    n:"just cause"
   </td> 
   </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
  
  You can combine multiple field limits in a single query.  For examples see the <a href="#advkw">Advanced Search</a> section.
<p>

Note:  Using a field prefix in your query overrides the relevancy ranking of keyword search results.  Records are sorted by the system default instead.

<p> <a name="dvd"><strong>Searching and Browsing for DVDs</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> If you are looking for a specific title, or you have specific search terms you want to use:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> By Title:  Select Title search, enter the first words of the title, and select DVDs from the pull-down menu.    </li>
    <li> By Keyword:  From Basic Keyword or Advanced Search, enter one or more words that you know (such as title, actors, director, etc.), and choose "DVDs" from the Material Type menu.   Example: hitchcock AND "cary grant"   </li>
  </ul>
  <p> If you don't have a DVD title in mind, there are some ways you can browse the Catalog for them.  </p>
  <ol>
  <li> If you're starting from the full record of a DVD in the catalog, just click on the item's call number near the bottom of the page.  This will initiate a call number search for nearby items.  Page backwards or forwards through the list using the Prev and Next links at the top. To see a title's location and availability, click on one of the call numbers in the list.
</li>

  <li>To browse recently added DVDs, select Call Number search and enter a high DVD number in the Other Call Number box.  (If you wish, you can limit this search to DVDs in the Audio-Visual Library by selecting that location from the  menu under the search box.)  DVDs are assigned numbers in the Catalog in order of their acquisition by the Libraries -- thus newly acquired DVDs will have higher numbers.  Entering a number higher than the one most recently added (e.g. "DVD 9000") will place you into the browse index at the end of the run of DVDs, and you can then page backwards to see recently added DVD titles.  
</li>

    <li> Select Title search and enter a single letter of the alphabet to start browsing in.  Select DVDs from the pulldown Location/Format menu.  After you see the results list, you can click the Limit/Sort button to apply language and/or date limits to your results if you wish.   </li>

    <li> Select Call Number search, and enter "DVD" into the Other Call Number box.  You can then apply location, language, date limits to the results by clicking the Limit/Sort button.  You can also re-sort them by title if you wish.    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> Notes on DVD languages and dates:   </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Language limits include alternative soundtrack languages (dubbing) or subtitles provided on a DVD.  For example, an English-language DVD might offer subtitles in Spanish and French.  Limiting results to Spanish language would also include this item, even though the primary language is English.  </li>

    <li> The date of a DVD is the publication date of that specific edition, which is not necessarily the same as the original release date of a film or broadcast date of a TV show.  For example, if you limit your results to DVDs released after 2004, you would still get a 2005 DVD edition of a film originally released in 1956.  Conversely, if you limit your search for the 1956 film with the dates 1955-1957, you will not retrieve the 2005 DVD version.  The film's original date is usually given as a note in the full record, but this is not indexed as a date.  </li>

<p> <a name="music"><strong>Searching and Browsing for Music Sound Recordings and Scores</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>

Use the basic Keyword search if you are looking just for CDs or DVDs.  
Enter a few words such as a composer's last name and some title words, and select CD or DVD from the Locations pull-down menu: <br>
     Example:  Stravinsky Rite Spring<br>
Or enter a performer's name<br>
     Example:   Anne-Sophie Mutter<br>
Or enter a group name and one or more title words:<br>
     Example:   beatles revolver
<p>

To browse the most recently added CDs go to the call number search page and under {u00D2}Other Call Number{u00D3} enter the format and a number higher than the last accession number: compact disc mu 40000.  You can then browse backwards through the list.  Alternatively, to find the CDs added in a particular year go to the Music search screen, type * in the main search box, check CDs in the material type list and enter the previous and following years in the date boxes (i.e., to find 2007 put After 2006 Before 2008).
<p>

Use the Music or Advanced keyword search to look for scores and/or recordings in a variety of formats.  Title words for musical genres should be entered in the plural or with a wildcard symbol (concertos, concerto*; sonatas, sonata*) even when looking for only one work.
<p>
Enter a few words such as a composer's last name and some title words, and use the pull-down material type menu to select one or more formats: <br>
	Example:  Beethoven Symphonies 9 [+ material type = Printed Music Scores] <br> 
This will find scores of Beethoven's 9th Symphony in any UT Libraries.
<p>
Use the Locations pull-down menu to limit searches just to the Fine Arts Library, where most scores are held.
<p>
You can use the Control key and highlighting to select more than one material type in a single search:<br>
Example:  Schubert Schone Mullerin [+ material types = Compact Discs, Records, Printed Music Scores]
<p>
You can search for titles of individual songs/tracks on CDs, other recordings, and in some scores, by entering the title in the keyword search box as a phrase (within quotation marks).
e.g., "on the sunny side of the street"
<p>
<i>It is not advisable to use the Title or Author + Title searches to find classical music recordings and scores. </i>

<p><a name="ebooks"><strong>Searching for Electronic Books (E-books)</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To find records for e-books, do any type of search and choose the limit "Electronic Resources" from the accompanying menu of options.  If you're using the Advanced Search page, you can enter a keyword search and select "Ebooks" from the material type menu.
</p>

<p>
Records for vendor e-books are separate from records for corresponding print editions.  Their catalog records also vary widely in quality.  If you search by title or author you will usually see all versions side by side.*  However, a keyword search might pull up one record but not the other(s).  This is because the record content can vary:  for example, one e-book vendor may supply a table of contents or abstract as part of the record, while the corresponding print edition record does not.  Your keyword search may hit some of the terms that only appear in one record.  To see if we have the title in a different format, follow up by doing a title browse search for it.
</p>
<p>
*  Some vendor-supplied e-book records for non-English books don't properly omit initial articles from the title string.  For example, a title browse search for copies of <cite>Les Trois Mousquetaires</cite> omitting the intial "Les" might miss an e-book version that includes the "Les" as a regular title word.  You can get around this by doing a keyword search instead of a title browse search, or by searching it both ways to be sure.  
</p>

<p> <a name="series"><strong>Searching for Books in Series</strong> </a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Many scholarly books are published as part of ongoing series.  Volumes in a series may or may not be numbered. Some series are shelved together at a single call number, using volume numbers, with each volume receiving a separate record in the catalog.  (This is known as an <b>analyzed series</b>.)  Other series are classified separately according to each volume's topic and are thus scattered in the library. In both cases, the series title and numbering are included and searchable in their bibliographic records.  </p>

  <p> The most effective way to locate a specific book within an analyzed or separately classified series is to use the Advanced Search form to do a keyword search for distinctive words in the series title along with a volume number. For example, to find volume 1029 of the series <cite>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</cite>, type 
<br>
annals new york 1029<br>
 in the search box.  This should pull the correct record up immediately.  Series that are cataloged this way will not be found using the Journal Title search option because they are not cataloged as serials. </p>

  <p> For serials that are not analyzed -- primarily those that do not have any volume-specific titles or editors -- all volumes will be listed under a single record.  Search for these items using the Title or Journal Title search option.  Example: <cite>Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences.</cite>  The method described above for locating specific volumes in an analyzed series will not work with this kind of serial publication.    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dissertations and theses in the Libraries' collections are cataloged in the same way books are, so they are fully searchable by author, title, or keyword.  </p>

  <p>PRINT:   If you're looking for <strong>printed</strong> dissertations or theses, you can limit your search by selecting "Dissertations/Theses" from the Locations menu.   </p>

  <p>
 ELECTRONIC:  Most dissertations submitted since 2000 exist only as digital files and have no hard copy in the library.  These are known as "Electronic Theses and Disserations" (ETDs).  They do not have call numbers. Search for them by author, title, or keyword. To narrow your search you can use the "Dissertations/Theses" or the "Electronic Resources" limit in the Locations menu.    You can then link to the electronic full text from UT-Austin's local ETD repository or UMI-Proquest.  (Access to UMI-Proquest dissertations is restricted to UT-Austin students, faculty and staff.  Some access restrictions may also apply to dissertations in UT-Austin's ETD database.)  
  </p>

    <p>Advanced Keyword Search:  There is no Material Type designation that is specific to dissertations or theses.  Adviser and department names can be searched as general keywords.  However, this information is only included for dissertations in recent years.

  <p>A link to this search page is found on the Advanced Search page.

This search finds records by the names of former owners, bookbinders, printers and presses, when those names are included in a bibliographic record.  This information pertains primarily to materials in the Harry Ransom Center (HRC), the Benson Latin American Collection, and the Center for American History.  Names entered in this search form should be entered last name first, as you would in an author search.
</p>

  <p>You can also use the Advanced Search page to do a more focused keyword search.  Names of former owners, printers, and binders are included in the Notes segment of the keyword index.  </p>

<p> <a name="lcshvskw"><strong>Subject Heading or Keyword?</strong> </a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Doing a Subject Heading search or using topical terms in a Keyword search are two different ways of doing the same thing -- finding materials on a particular topic.    </p>

  <p> <strong>Keyword</strong> searches are more general and will retrieve materials that have the desired terms not only in Subject Headings, but anywhere in the record.  Your results will be more numerous but less focused, and there may be some results that are not relevant at all.  </p>

  <p> <strong>Subject Heading</strong> searches are more focused, and rely on human catalogers who have assigned specific controlled vocabulary descriptors to a particular work.  Subject heading assignment is not always consistent over time or across subject areas.  If you rely solely on subject headings you may miss relevant materials that do not have certain headings assigned to them.  In addition, not all records in the Catalog have subject headings -- works of fiction, music and art, and other materials with minimal cataloging often lack subject headings.  </p>


  <p> It's a good idea to use both techniques when searching by topic.  Start with a keyword search, and examine the subject headings found on relevant records, then search those as well to find other materials that may not contain the keywords you started with.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> <a name="case"><strong>Upper Case vs. Lower Case</strong> </a>  </p>

<blockquote>
All searches in the Catalog are case-insensitive.  It does not matter whether you type in upper or lower case.
</blockquote>


<p> <a name="punct"><strong>Punctuation in Search Queries</strong> </a>  </p>

<blockquote>
Punctuation is usually ignored by the search engine, with the following exceptions in Keyword searches:
<ul>
<li>Wildcard symbols * and ? (<a href="#truncation">see above</a>) </li>
<li>Colon (:) must be omitted unless used with field tag prefixes for title, author, subject heading, and note fields (t: a: d: n:) </li>
<li>Quotes ("...") are used to search bound phrases, i.e. words exactly in the order typed.  </li>
</ul>
In all other instances the system substitutes a space for a punctuation mark.  When searching hyphenated terms it does not matter if you use a hyphen or a space.  Example:  tailor-made is the same as tailor made; but tailormade will not work.

<p> <strong>Diacritics and Special Characters </strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Special characters and diacritic marks should display when they are present in the catalog record.  However, many records do not reliably contain these modified characters and display without them.     </p>

  <p> In most cases you can type or paste a search query with special characters and the system will search for only that modified character, retrieving matching words with the diacritic.  Thus, a search for "&eacute;tranger" will not retrieve "etranger".  However, if you search "etranger" without the diacritic you will retrieve all records with or without the diacritic.  For this reason it is better to leave the diacritics off your search terms to ensure full retrieval.  </p>

  <p> If your browser displays these characters incorrectly, using non-alpha characters such as boxes or dots, some fonts and encoding settings on your computer may be missing or set improperly.  Contact library staff for assistance.  </p>

  <p> <u>What can I search using non-Latin script?</u>  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> The catalog is not multilingual; searches in non-Latin scripts will ONLY display records for items in the catalog that have these scripts present in the AUTHOR, TITLE, or names used as SUBJECTS fields.  Catalog records for many materials in these languages, especially older materials, lack these scripts and thus are not searchable using non-Latin scripts. To be sure that you've found all materials in a given language, you must do a normal search using transliterated words in the Latin character set.  Use the Advanced Keyword search option to enter keywords and limit results to specific languages.   </p>

    <p> You can search for AUTHORS, TITLES, and names used as SUBJECTS in the Catalog.  </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p> <u>How do I enter a non-Latin script search into the online catalog?</u>  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> o	Windows users:  Make sure that your computer has Microsoft IMEs enabled for the script you want.  To see which keyboards have been enabled for your machine, go to (Control panel > Regional and language options > Languages > Details > Settings.  </p>

    <p> To key non-Latin script into the search box, press &lt;left ALT&gt; &lt;left SHIFT&gt; keys, and then type your search.   Make sure that your cursor is in the search box before typing a script search.  </p>

    <p> To switch back to searching in Latin characters, press &lt;left ALT&gt; &lt;left SHIFT&gt; again.   

    </p>
    <p> If multiple keyboards have been installed, you can use the language bar at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen to switch between input languages with your mouse  </p>

  <p> <u>Do I need special software to display Arabic script?</u>  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> You should not need any special software.  However, the Web browser you use is an important variable. Microsoft Internet Explorer V.5 or higher / Netscape 6 are the best bets for Windows users.  Macintosh users should prefer Firefox; Safari does not handle Arabic script well.

KNOWN ISSUE:  Misleading "Electronic Resource" Links for HRC Periodicals <br>
The Library Catalog contains records for materials held in the <a href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/">Harry Ransom Center</a> (HRC).   Records for periodicals have an "Electronic Resource" link which takes you to HRC's <a href="http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/periodicals/index.cfm">database of periodical holdings</a>, where you must redo your search to determine what pieces of the periodical are held, and what collections they are part of.  The link in the Catalog does NOT lead to full text of that resource.  If you're looking for online access to a journal or periodical, locate the non-HRC record and click the "Find it @ UT" button on that record.
</p>

<p>

KNOWN ISSUE:  Records without call numbers or locations <br>
Some records appear as "mystery" bibliographic records without any call number, location or status.  This can have several causes.
<ul>
<li>Electronic-only title - Records for electronic resources that have no physical counterpart in the collection have no "location" or status information and no call number.  These include electronic journals, e-books, electronic theses/dissertations, etc.  To access the content, click on the "Find it @ UT" button on the record or the "Electronic Resource" link in the record.  Most of this content is restricted to current UT-Austin students, faculty and staff. </li>

<li>No remaining pieces - Some records (usually older titles) show no available items because all pieces have been withdrawn from the collection.  Going forward these records will be suppressed from public view, but there are many such records left over from our system migration that are still visible.  You can report these via the Feedback form and we will suppress them individually. </li>

<a name="status"><strong>Item Status Displays</strong></a>  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Each item attached to a bibliographic record has a current status shown next to its call number.  This is what these statuses mean:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> AVAILABLE &ndash; Available for check-out.  </li>
    <li> LIB USE ONLY &ndash; Library Use Only (non-circulating).  </li>
    <li> DUE (Date) &ndash; Currently charged to a library borrower and due back on the date shown.  </li>
    <li> RECENTLY CHECKED IN &ndash; Item was checked in within the last day and may still be on its way back to the shelf.  Check the shelf and ask for assistance if you can't find it.  </li>
    <li> IN TRANSIT &ndash; Item is on its way to another library.  When the item is checked in at its destination, it will no longer show "in transit".  </li>
    <li> ON HOLD SHELF &ndash; Currently being held for a borrower who has requested it.  </li>
    <li>ASK AT DESK &ndash; Ask library staff for further information.</li>
    <li> BEING SEARCHED &ndash; Not on the shelf and currently being searched for by staff.  </li>
    <li> MISSING &ndash; Has been searched by staff but was not located.  You can request missing titles via Interlibrary Services.  </li>
    <li> OVERDUE BILLED &ndash; Checked out, overdue, and borrower has been billed for the item.  The item may be returned eventually.  You can request overdue billed titles via Interlibrary Services. </li>
    <li>LOST BILLED &ndash; Item was lost and billed to a borrower in our legacy system before May 2007; it is no longer available. You can request lost billed titles via Interlibrary Services.</li>
    <li>LOST PAID &ndash; Item was lost and paid for by a borrower; it is no longer available.  You can request lost paid titles via Interlibrary Services.
<p>
Note:  Lost and missing items are not routinely replaced.  If you wish to request that the library replace such an item, please submit a <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/request/">Purchase Request Form</a>.
</li>
    <li> RECENTLY ADDED &ndash; Item was added to the catalog within the last week or so.  It may not yet be on the shelf.  Ask staff if you can't find it.  </li>
    <li> AT BINDERY &ndash; A periodical currently out for binding and unavailable.  Check for electronic access or use Interlibrary Services to request articles from volumes at bindery, and make a note of the bindery status in the request.  </li>
    <li> BEING BOUND &ndash; Unavailable pending binding by library staff.  </li>
    <li> BEING REPAIRED &ndash; Being repaired in PCL Preservation Services.  The item is not available. </li>
    <li> IN UNIT REPAIR &ndash; Being repaired in the owning unit.  </li>
    <li> IN PROCESS &ndash; Being processed and not yet available.  You can place a Request on it and it will be held for you when it is ready.  </li>
    <li> UNAVAILABLE &ndash; Not currently available for checkout; ask library staff for further information.  </li>
    <li> STAFF USE &ndash; Unavailable to borrowers.  Ask staff for further information.  </li>
<p>
</ul>
In addition to the item statuses above, materials that have been ordered but not yet received or processed are also included in the Catalog:
<ul>
<li> ORDERED for [Location] &ndash;  This display, which appears only on the Full Record screen, indicates that the book has been ordered but has not yet arrived.   </li> 

  </ul>
You can click the Request button to place a hold on these ordered materials, and after it arrives and is processed you will be notified that it is available on the hold shelf at the owning location. (If the item is designated non-circulating or otherwise restricted, your hold will be cancelled and you'll be notified of this.)
<p>
Placing a hold on an item that has not yet arrived does not expedite receipt of the book from the vendor or publisher.  It is not possible to rush the shipping of an order that has already been placed, but it will be processed promptly upon arrival.

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can view current issue receipt information for printed journals, periodicals, magazines and other serial-type publications that are currently received in the Libraries.  Click on the "Latest Received" link on the Full Record screen to see a table showing what recent issues have been received, with the dates of receipt, as well as issues that are late or anticipated.  
<p>
The dates shown in these boxes represent the item's date of arrival in the PCL Serials Department.  Items are then routed to the appropriate shelving location, and there may be a delay of a day or two before an issue arrives at its destination.   Items that are cataloged immediately for the stacks (such as annuals and some series) may take longer.  If you have trouble locating a specific issue of a periodical, ask staff in the owning library unit for assistance.
<p>
Receipt data is not available for electronic journals, hardcopy newspapers, or titles that have ceased, been cancelled, or which have been inactive for a long period of time.

<p> <a name="vols"><strong>Multiple volumes/copies display</strong></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many bibliographic records have multiple pieces attached to them (such as journals, multi-volume sets, and multiple copies).  On the Brief Results display, up to <strong>three items</strong> are shown, with a note that there are additional copies or volumes.  </p>

  <p>On the Full Record display, up to <strong>ten items</strong> are listed.  If more than ten items are attached, click on the button at the bottom to "View additional copies or search for a specific volume/copy."  This will display the entire list of items.  Serials are listed in reverse chronological order.  Non-serial materials, such as encyclopedia sets, are listed in volume-number order. </p>

<p>
Note:  The 3/10 display limit is determined by the software, and we can't change this locally. 
</p>

  <p>To find a specific volume of a serial or periodical with more than ten attached pieces, it's best to display and scan the entire list.  Optionally, you can enter a volume number or year in the box below the 10-item short display, and then click the View additional... button.  (If the volume you want does not appear, clear the box and view the entire list.  Variations in the way volume numbers and years are indicated in call numbers may cause a specific volume not to show up in a search.)

<p> <a name="links"><strong>Web Links, Book Covers, and Tags</strong></a>  </p>



  <ul>
    <li> Find It @ UT button:  This button, which appears on any catalog record that contains an ISBN or ISSN, will take you to a menu of available options specific to this item, which may or may not include full text access to the content.  <strong>This button is the primary link from the Catalog to electronic journal content.</strong>  For books, the menu may contain links to e-book providers, but this is not comprehensive.   </li>
<p>

    <li> "Electronic Resource" link: This link appears in a brief record whenever there is a URL present in a bibliographic record.  Many different kinds of links may be found:  a full text e-book, a government document on the Web, an electronic dissertation or thesis, etc.  For periodicals held in the Harry Ransom Center, the link goes to HRC's local periodicals holdings database.  View the full record to see more information about where this link will take you.  To open this link in a new browser window or tab, right-click on the link.   </li>
<p>
<li>Book Covers:  The Catalog links via a book's ISBN to Amazon.com to provide additional information related to certain materials.  Amazon's thumbnail cover image, when available, is displayed on the brief and full record pages.  Click on the cover to go to the Amazon information page for the book, where you may use services such as reader reviews and tags, editorial reviews, and "Search Inside" features, and purchase a copy.  
<p>
Occasionally the cover image does not match the book in the catalog record.  This is due to an ISBN conflict or error, which is usually the fault of the publisher or Amazon.  If the ISBN in our record matches the physical item, there is nothing the Libraries can do to fix it.  </li> 
  
   <p>

<li>Google Books:  A button links to Google Books when Google offers preview or full-text content for that title.  This link looks for an exact match for the bibliographic edition in the Catalog; other editions may be available if you search <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> directly. This is especially true if you're looking for an e-book version of a classic out-of-copyright work that has been republished in multiple editions.  See also under <a href="#viewebooks">Viewing Electronic Books</a> below. 
</li>
<p>
<li>Permanent Link:  If you want to bookmark a specific record in your browser, or copy a persistent link to that record for use elsewhere, click on "Bookmark Link."  This will reload the current record using a stable URL.  Then do a bookmark/add to favorites command in your browser, or copy the URL from the browser address line. </li>
<p>

<li>LibraryThing:  User tags from <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing.com</a> are displayed in a box on the full record screen, when this information is available for a book.    The "Recommended Books" list shows other titles that have similar tags, as well as ISBN links to alternate editions and translations of the same work.  Clicking on a tag will open a tag browser window which shows related tags and a list of books in the Library Catalog that share that tag.  LibraryThing tags are contributed by users around the world.  Tags are not maintained or controlled by UT Libraries, and we can't remove "bad" tags.  To contribute tags of your own, you need to register for a free account directly on the LibraryThing site.

<p> <a name="viewebooks"><strong>Viewing Electronic Books</strong></a>  </p>

<ul>

<li>The University Libraries offer access to electronic books (e-books) from a number of different vendors, including EBL, Ebsco (NetLibrary), and Ebrary.  The interfaces and access requirements vary by provider.  
E-book records in the Catalog are usually separate from records for corresponding print editions, so you may encounter multiple records for print and for one or more e-versions of the same book.  

  <p>
<li>Click on the link in the record display to go to electronic content.   If you are off-campus, you will be asked to enter your UT EID before viewing the full text of a licensed e-book.  
<p>
<li>The Find It @ UT button sometimes links to e-book access options, but this is not comprehensive.   See the <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/books/etext.html">Electronic Books</a> page for more information on our e-book vendors and categories. 
</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="export"><strong>Marking, Saving and Exporting Records</strong></a> 
</p>

<p>
The Catalog allows you to mark and save bibliographic records.  These records are temporarily saved to a "clipboard" area awaiting your action.  From the clipboard you can either export/email records immediately, or save them indefinitely to your "My Lists" area in your account for later action.   
    <strong>Records saved to the Clipboard are deleted after 20 minutes, or when you close your browser, whichever comes first. </strong>  To avoid losing your work over a longer period of time, use the My Lists function instead.

</p>
<p>
<OL>
 <li>To mark a record, click the "Save to Clipboard" button in a brief or full record display.  After you do this you will see buttons to "View Clipboard" and "Empty Clipboard" at the top of the screen. The "Add to Clipboard" button for a selected record will change to a "Remove From Clipboard" button.  A "Save All to Clipboard" button is available on the Index display from browse search results. This saves only the records displayed on that screen, not the entirety of your search results.  
</li>

    <li>Click the "View Clipboard" button to see the list of your marked records.  To delete selected records from the list, mark their checkboxes and click the Delete Selected button.</li>

<li>To export/email, click the Export Saved button.  </li>

    <li>Choose the format for export:  Full Display (the default); or format them for EndNote/RefWorks bibliographic management software.  [More information on <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/resources/end_faq.html">EndNote use</a>]
<p>
KNOWN ISSUE: The call number(s) is exported only in the Full Display format.  (Call numbers are not included in the EndNote format.)  The call numbers of all attached items will be included in the full record export, so if you export a record for a periodical you will get a list of call numbers representing all the attached volumes for that title. </li>

    <li>Choose a destination for the records:  E-mail (enter your address in the box provided); your browser screen (for printing); or download a file to a local disk. </li>

    <li>Click Submit.  If you chose to e-mail, a confirmation message will display.  If you chose to download to a file, you will be asked for file information.  To return to your place in the catalog, click the Previous Screen button.

</li>

    <li>If you choose to print the records from the screen export, your printout will include the accompanying graphics and layout of the catalog web pages.  For a cleaner, text-only printout, you should first email or export the records, and then print from a file.

</li>

     <li>To clear your saved records, click the "Empty Clipboard" button. </li>

  </ol>

  <p>
The <strong>My Lists</strong> feature allows you to save selected records to lists you create within your library account.  Unlike the Clipboard, these saved records will remain in your account until you delete them.  
<ol>
<li>Add desired records to the Clipboard and then click View Clipboard.</li>
<li>Edit your list and click Add to My Lists. </li>
<li>Log in with your UT EID if you are not already logged in. </li>
<li>Select an existing list or create a new one. </li>
<li>To view your lists, click the My Record button. </li>
<li>You can delete selected records or export the list. 
<p>
KNOWN ISSUE:  The "Add Marked to My Lists" button works only from browse-type index screens, where entries have checkboxes that can be marked.  It has no function from brief bibliographic display screens or in keyword search results.  </li>

</ol>

<p> <a name="print"><strong>Printing from the Catalog</strong></a>  </p>

<p>
Printing directly from the Library Catalog is awkward.  The formatting of the browser displays does not provide printer-friendly copy and wastes paper.  
Instead of printing from your browser, it's better to save records to the Clipboard as described <a href="#export">above</a>, then export them to your email or to a text file, and print from that.  Exported records are text-only and can be edited prior to printing.  Be sure to export records in the "Full" format in order to include associated call numbers.

  <p>  To log in to your library account space, click the "Renew & Library Account" button at the top of any screen.  Enter your valid UT EID and password.  You will be taken to your patron record display, which offers a number of options.  To log out, just click the Logout button at the top of any screen.  Be sure to log out of your account whenever you leave a shared or public workstation.  
</p>

<p>
KNOWN ISSUE:  If your EID password contains an angle-bracket character (<strong>< </strong> or <strong> > </strong>), you will not be able to log into the Catalog system.  This is due to a security feature coded into the system by the software vendor.  You will have to change your password to replace those characters in order to log in.

<p>  <a name="renew"> <strong>Renewing Your Books </strong> </a>   </p>

  <p> Library borrowers may renew most of their charged materials online. Exceptions to this include items with recalls or holds; short-period loan items (such as Reserves materials); items overdue and billed.  
</p>

<ol>
 <li>   Log in to your My Account space using your UT EID and password.</li>

   <li>    You will see the items checked out to you.</li>

   <li>   Select the materials you wish to renew by checking the boxes in the RENEW column and then click the Renew Selected button. If you want to renew everything, click the Renew ALL button.</li>

  <li>    If you cannot renew items, a message will appear on the screen. If you are successful, a new due date will appear in the "STATUS" column. Always check the STATUS column for information on the success or failure of your renewal.</li>

<li> If you aren't allowed to renew and the message "Highest level overdue" displays, this means that a book checked out to you has been recalled, and is now overdue. Your checkout and renewal privileges are blocked until the book is returned.  </li>

   <li> You may not be able to renew a large number of items all at once with a single click of the Renew ALL button. If the system does not respond, try exiting My Account, going back in and renewing the items in smaller batches by checking boxes in the RENEW column and clicking the Renew Selected button.</li>


   <li>  Review your list carefully to make sure everything has been renewed. If items cannot be or are not renewed in My Account, you are responsible for presenting them at a library circulation desk for renewal, or returning them to the library, by the date due, to avoid overdue charges.</li>

<p>


<ol>
<li>To request retrieval and delivery of an eligible item, click the <strong>Request</strong> link on the record.  In the brief display, this link is shown to the right; on the full record display it is found in the row of links at the top.  The Request link will not be shown on records that are not eligible for this service. </li>

<li> Log in with your UT EID.  You must have a UT EID and current checkout privileges to use this service.   </li>

<li> A list of items will display.  Requestable items will have a radio button.  Note:  Some materials in storage are restricted, and these are not requestable online.  Submit a paper retrieval request in person at the circulation desk of the owning library. </li>

<li>Select the desired item.   (If you need multiple volumes of a title, you must request each volume separately. The system does not allow a single request for multiple items.)  Click REQUEST SELECTED ITEM at the bottom. </li>

<li> Choose a pickup location. You may choose the owning library if you wish.   </li>

<li> The system will place a retrieval request and the item will be delivered to the Hold Shelf in the library you selected.  You will be notified by email when it is ready for pickup. The item will be held for you for 7 days.</li>

<a name="storage"> <b>Requesting Materials from Library Storage</b></a>

<p>
Requesting retrieval of materials held in the Library Storage Facility (LSF) or the Collections Deposit Library (CDL) works the same as Materials Retrieval above.  You must have a UT EID to place a request in the Catalog.  If you do not have a UT EID, you may submit a retrieval request in person at a circulation desk in a campus library. 
<p>
Turnaround time is generally 2 business days and you may select a campus library pickup location most convenient to you.  Rush service is not available.  Items in CDL may be requested there in person if you want to obtain it faster.  Items in LSF may only be requested online, not in person.  
<p>

<strong> <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/ils/electronic.html">Article Delivery Service:</a></strong>  If you want an article scanned from a journal held in the <strong>Library Storage Facility</strong>, you don't have to request delivery of the whole volume.  Just click the link on the login page to go to the <a href="https://lib-pclcz020.austin.utexas.edu/illiad/IXA/illiad.dll?Action=10&Form=30&genre=article">Article Delivery Request Form</a>.  If you already have an account with the Interlibrary Services system, you can log in there with your EID, and enter the article and volume information.  If you don't have an account you'll need to create one, which just takes a few moments. You must be a current student, faculty, or stafft to use this free service.  You'll be notified by email when the document is ready for you to access, and turnaround time is usually two business days.

<p>
<li> You can sort the list by pickup location, mark selected requests to cancel, or click on cancel all to cancel all the requests you have placed.  Once you cancel a request, you can't reinstate it - if you change your mind about canceling, you must start over and request the item again. </li>
<p>
<li> Items that are ready for you to pick up show "Ready. Must pick up by [date]".  You will be notified by e-mail when your requested item is ready for pick-up.  Until a request shows the Ready status, it is NOT ready to pick up.  </li>
<p>
<li> Items that are still checked out to someone else show a due date in the Status column. If your request shows, "2 of 2 holds", this means that you are second in the request queue for the item: it is on the hold shelf for the first person in the queue. </li>
<p>
<li> Items requested from storage will continue to display "Available" status, even after the request is placed, until they actually leave the storage facility and begin to display "In transit". They are NOT ready for you to pick up until they display the "Ready" status. </li>

<li> If any of the items currently checked out to you is overdue, your list of Checked Out Items in My Library Account displays the fine that would be charged if the overdue item were returned or renewed today. However, if you have already been billed for the item-it appears as OVERDUE BILLED -- the amount actually due if you do not return the item is the amount of the bill as shown in Unpaid Fines, not the overdue fine shown in the list of Checked Out Items. </li>

    <li> The next time that you log in to your Account, you can click the "Preferred Searches" button to see a list of your saved searches.  </li>  

    <li> Click on the search link associated with any of the preferred search terms in the list to quickly execute your search.  </li>  

    <li>You can be alerted of new materials matching your searches added to the library collection. Just check the "Mark for Email" box and be sure that your patron record information includes your current email address.  Searches will be run weekly on Sunday nights, and results will be emailed to your designated address. 
</li> 
    <li> To turn off the email alert, just go to your Preferred Searches list, uncheck the Mark for Email box, and click Update List.  You can delete all your saved searches by clicking the Clear all Searches button.  </li>

<p>  <a name="rhistory"><strong>Your Reading History </strong> </a>   </p>


  <p>
This feature allows you to track your circulation history. It is the only way you can retrieve information about your past checkouts after the fact.  (Library staff do not have access to this information, unless a fee was charged at some point.)    
<p>
<ol>
<li> Log into Renew & My Account. </li> 
<li> Click on "My Reading History" </li> 
<li> Click "Opt In" </li> 
</ol>
<p>
After you enable Reading History, the system will start collecting a list of items as you check them out from that time forward. Items currently checked out at the time of opting in are not added to your reading history.  Items requested through Interlibrary Loan will not be included in your history.
<p>
You may delete any or all of the entries in your own reading history, at any time, without opting out.  You may discontinue the collection of your Reading History at any time. To turn off the option, first clear all entries from your circulation history, using the check boxes and "Delete All" button. Then click "Opt Out".
